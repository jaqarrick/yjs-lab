# What is a CRDT or _Conflict Free Replicated Data Types_?

[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) are data structures that can be replicated across multiple computers in a network. These replicas can be updated independently or concurrently without coordination between the replicas and resolve themselves automatically. 

Inconsistencies i.e. conflicts are resolved through a *conflict resolution algorithms*. 

## Why CRDTs are _useful_
Multi-user editing and collaboration over networks presents a vast array of issues. To illustrate where things can go wrong, even in a simple 2-user environment, let's consider the following examples. 

In the simplest case, two users have replicate sets of letters. If each user performs a transaction on their set, those transactions could then be sent to the other user. The transactions can be unionized, and then each user performs the actions from the other user:

![set_of_letters](/images/list.png)

Each user ends up with the correct, expected list of letters. This is all well and good, but in the _real world_ things aren't this simple. Consider another _slightly more complex_ example. 

Say we have two replicates of a string. In order to keep track of the letters, we assign each of the letters an _index_. When we remove or insert a letter, we supply the letter and the place to insert or remove it. However, this can cause some issues. In the figure below, one user deletes a letter at position 2, while the other user deletes a letter at position 1 _and_ inserts a letter at 7. When these the users exchange actions, incorrect letters are removed and the string becomes _jumbled_.

A possible solution to this issue is to _transform_ the operation that a user performs _after_ an edit by a second user. For example if user A deletes the 6th index from the string, user B's operation of adding 's' to the 7th index would be transformed to `insert s at position (7-1)`

This is a _extremely_ boiled down example of a Ëšvmethod called [operational transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation), which is a solution for conflict resolution. However, this is a very _limited_ approach. Many iterations have tried and failed at solving issues where more than 2 users are editing a document, or manipulating data, at once. In fact, Google Docs uses OT, however this only works because a central _Google Server_ acts as the arbiter between multiple peers. With OT, a true multi-user editing system is very difficult. 

Here enters CRDTs, which attempt to solve concurrency issues through resolution algorithms, allowing for a seamless multi-user editing system. 

## Strong Eventual Consistently
Generally consistency in distributed systems can be _strong_ or _eventual_. Strong consistency allows for sequential writes, but is impossible when users are disconnected from each other and aren't available with [network partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition). Eventual consistency allows for individual partitions to converge _eventually_, but these can be complicated algorithms that are hard to test.

CRDTs _raise the bar_ in striving for _strong eventual consistency_. Once two nodes have seen the same event, they are immediately in the same state. 



## Types of CRDTs
There are two main approaches when designing a CRDT. 
1. **Operation-based CRDTs** - transmit only the operation. The replicas receive the operations and apply them locally. 
2. **State-based CRDTs** - Send the whole local state to other replicates. These are easier to implement, but are more costly. 

## Operation-based CRDT
OP-based CRDTs need to follow a set of rules to assure strong eventual consistency. 
1. All concurrent operations must commute
    - ie. `(x*2)-1 !== (x-1)*2` but `(x-4)-3 === (x-3)-4`
2. Assume that updates are applied **exactly once**
3. Updates must be applied _in the order from which they were sent from their origin_.

In the example below, two users are sharing simple counter data. What is shared between the users is the actual _operation_ that each user attempts to perform. The **action** is performed locally, increasing or decreasing the value, and then shared with the second user. 

In the second figure, the value is a `map` and not a number. Concurrency is dealt with in this case by assigning each entry a unique id (in this case `Xa` or `Xb`) that that additions and removals can be tracked accurately.

## State-based CRDTs
These update the local state, then send the state and merge with other users. 
1. Allow for retransmissions. The merge function should be [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), i.e. no matter how many times you apply a transformation, the end result will always be the same. 
2. We need a concept of 'going forward', i.e. clocks. 
3. Updates and merges always go forward and must increase the state in this order. 

In the example of a state-based CRDT algorithm below, the entire state, in this case an object containing all actions performed on the `a` property. Whenever a local transaction occurs, the whole state is passed `{a: +3, -5}`, for example.

## Where does Yjs Fit In?

Yjs' CRDT algorithm is best described with a visual example. Assume we have a document with the characters AB already written. One user wants to insert "C" between these characters. 

In Yjs, every character is assigned a unique identifier/timestamp, a pair of integers with the first representing the _user identifier_ or the user who performed the operation and the second representing an incrementing clock. 

For instance, the C would have the coordinates `(0,0)` for the user `0` and clock `0`.

_[source](https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/yjs-deep-dive-part-2)_

The C is inserted and now the same user wants to insert a D in between C and B. This character would have the identifier of `0,1`. It is the same user `0`, but the clock has incremented to `1`. 

Let's say a different user inserts an E in between A and B, but the timestamp is `0`. Here we have a concurrency conflict. 

Yjs resolves this by looking at the id. If the clocks are the same, but the ids are different, Yjs compares them and gives preference to the lower user id. The resulting document is therefore `ACDEB`.

##### Concatenation and efficiency
For efficiency, Yjs doesn't store a time stamp for every unique character, but rather stores groups of characters as items. If one user types the string 'ABC', the timestamp would be supplied to the entire string: `ABC(0,0)`. If another user wanted to insert a character 'D' in between this string, the result would be a split item: `A(0,0) D(1,1) BC(0,0)`.
